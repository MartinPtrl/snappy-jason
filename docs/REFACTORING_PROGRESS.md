# Refactoring Progress - Snappy Jason

## 📊 Migration Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

**Goal:** Set up the architecture foundation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** September 2025

#### Completed Tasks:

- [x] Installed Zustand for state management
- [x] Created feature-based folder structure (`src/features/`)
- [x] Set up shared utilities folder (`src/shared/`)
- [x] Extracted TypeScript interfaces to `src/shared/types.ts`
- [x] Updated imports in App.tsx
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation

#### Files Changed:

- `package.json` - Added Zustand dependency
- `src/shared/types.ts` - New file with all interfaces
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated imports to use shared types
- Folder structure created for features

### 🚧 Phase 2: File Operations Feature (Next)

**Goal:** Extract file operations into dedicated feature
**Status:** 🚧 Planning
**Estimated:** 1-2 hours

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Create `src/features/file/fileStore.ts` with Zustand store
- [ ] Extract file operations logic to `useFileOperations.ts` hook
- [ ] Move file-related functions from App.tsx
- [ ] Update App.tsx to use new file feature
- [ ] Test file loading/saving functionality

#### Target Functions to Extract:

- `loadFile()` - File loading logic
- `saveLastOpenedFile()` - Config persistence
- `loadLastOpenedFile()` - Config restoration
- `clearLastOpenedFile()` - Config cleanup
- `unloadFile()` - File clearing logic

### 📋 Phase 3: Tree Feature (Planned)

**Goal:** Extract tree view components and infinite scroll
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Estimated:** 2-3 hours

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Move `TreeNode` and `TreeNodeContainer` to `src/features/tree/`
- [ ] Create `treeStore.ts` for expansion state management
- [ ] Extract infinite scroll logic to `useInfiniteScroll.ts`
- [ ] Create `useTreeOperations.ts` for tree-specific logic
- [ ] Update components to use new tree feature

---

### 📋 Phase 4: Search Feature (Planned)

**Goal:** Extract search functionality
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Estimated:** 2-3 hours

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Create `src/features/search/searchStore.ts`
- [ ] Extract search logic to `useSearch.ts` hook
- [ ] Move search components to search feature
- [ ] Implement search result pagination with infinite scroll
- [ ] Update App.tsx to use search feature

---

### 📋 Phase 5: App Cleanup (Planned)

**Goal:** Clean up main App component
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Estimated:** 1-2 hours

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Remove extracted logic from App.tsx
- [ ] Simplify App component to orchestrate features
- [ ] Add error boundaries for each feature
- [ ] Optimize re-renders and performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript types

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- [ ] App.tsx reduced from ~910 lines to <200 lines
- [ ] Each feature is independently testable
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode with no errors
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns

### Developer Experience

- [ ] New developers can understand codebase in <30 minutes
- [ ] Adding new features doesn't affect existing ones
- [ ] Hot reload works seamlessly during development
- [ ] Easy to debug individual features

### Performance

- [ ] App startup time remains <2 seconds
- [ ] Large JSON files (>10MB) load smoothly
- [ ] Search remains responsive with 1000+ results
- [ ] Memory usage doesn't increase during refactor

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If any phase causes issues:

1. **Git reset** to previous working commit
2. **Identify** the specific problem component
3. **Fix** the issue in isolation
4. **Re-apply** the refactor with fixes

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well

- **Incremental approach** prevents breaking changes
- **Feature-based organization** makes code easier to understand
- **TypeScript extraction** caught several type inconsistencies
- **Documentation-first** approach helps maintain clarity

### Challenges Encountered

- _Will be updated as we progress through phases_

### Improvements for Next Time

- _Will be updated based on experience_
