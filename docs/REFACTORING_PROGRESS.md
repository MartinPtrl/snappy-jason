- [x] Set up shared utilities folder (`src/shared/`)
- [x] Extracted TypeScript interfaces to `src/shared/types.ts`
- [x] Updated imports in App.tsx
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation

#### Files Changed:

- `package.json` - Added Zustand dependency
- `src/shared/types.ts` - New file with all interfaces
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated imports to use shared types
- Folder structure created for features

### ✅ Phase 2: File Operations Feature (Completed)

**Goal:** Extract file operations into dedicated feature with progress and cancel
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** September 16–17, 2025

#### Completed Tasks:

- [x] Create `src/features/file/fileStore.ts` with Zustand store
- [x] Extract file operations logic to `useFileOperations.ts` hook
- [x] Persist last-opened file and restore on startup
- [x] Show parse progress and support cancellation
- [x] Update `App.tsx` to use new file feature

#### Commands Used:

- `open_file`, `load_children`, `save_last_opened_file`, `load_last_opened_file`, `clear_last_opened_file`, `cancel_parse`

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Tree Feature (Completed)

**Goal:** Extract tree view components and infinite scroll
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** September 16–17, 2025

#### Completed Tasks:

- [x] Move `Tree`, `TreeNode`, `TreeNodeContainer` to `src/features/tree/`
- [x] Create `treeStore.ts` for expansion state
- [x] Implement `useTreeOperations.ts` (expand one level, collapse all)
- [x] Root-level infinite scroll via IntersectionObserver

---

### � Phase 4: Search Feature (In Progress)

**Goal:** Integrate scalable search with paging and highlighting
**Status:** � In Progress
**Date:** September 16–17, 2025

#### Current Functionality:

- [x] Search keys, values, and/or paths
- [x] Options: case sensitive, whole word, regex (exclusive where applicable)
- [x] Infinite scroll of results with `offset/limit` paging
- [x] Highlighting of matches and optional full string preview per result
- [x] Empty-search target notification

#### Next Steps:

- [ ] Extract search state to `src/features/search/` (optional)
- [ ] Add unit tests for search options and paging

---

### 📋 Phase 5: App Cleanup (Planned)

**Goal:** Clean up main App component
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Estimated:** 1-2 hours

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Remove extracted logic from App.tsx
- [ ] Simplify App component to orchestrate features
- [ ] Add error boundaries for each feature
- [ ] Optimize re-renders and performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript types

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- [ ] App.tsx reduced from ~910 lines to <200 lines
- [ ] Each feature is independently testable
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode with no errors
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns

### Developer Experience

- [ ] New developers can understand codebase in <30 minutes
- [ ] Adding new features doesn't affect existing ones
- [ ] Hot reload works seamlessly during development
- [ ] Easy to debug individual features

### Performance

- [ ] App startup time remains <2 seconds
- [ ] Large JSON files (>10MB) load smoothly
- [ ] Search remains responsive with 1000+ results
- [ ] Memory usage doesn't increase during refactor

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If any phase causes issues:

1. **Git reset** to previous working commit
2. **Identify** the specific problem component
3. **Fix** the issue in isolation
4. **Re-apply** the refactor with fixes

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well

- **Incremental approach** prevents breaking changes
- **Feature-based organization** makes code easier to understand
- **TypeScript extraction** caught several type inconsistencies
- **Documentation-first** approach helps maintain clarity

### Challenges Encountered

- _Will be updated as we progress through phases_

### Improvements for Next Time

- _Will be updated based on experience_
