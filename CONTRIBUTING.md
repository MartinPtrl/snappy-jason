# Contributing to Snappy Jason

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to Contribute

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a feature branch from the default branch
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages
4. Run the app locally (`yarn tauri dev`) and ensure there are no errors
5. Open a PR with a concise description and screenshots if UI changes

## Code Style

- TypeScript/React with strict types preferred
- One feature per PR whenever possible
- Keep components focused; move logic to hooks and stores

## Docs

- Update docs under `docs/` when changing architecture or developer workflow
- Keep the root `README.md` user-focused

## Issues

- Use issues for bugs and feature requests
- Include steps to reproduce and logs when possible
